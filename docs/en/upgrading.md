# Upgrading

## From 2 to 3
- Namespace under `AntonyThorpe\SilverShopJsonResponse`
- Localisation pathways placed under classes.  Have removed the full caps so these will all need changing.
- The current Cart is returned in all response data
- The `variations` key has been removed and replaced by `subtitle`
